#### The Three Little <i class="fas fa-tag"></i>

Once upon a time there was an old mother tag who had three little tags and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.

The first little tag was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little tag worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.

The third little tag worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.

The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little tags lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the tag inside. He thought the tag would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.\
